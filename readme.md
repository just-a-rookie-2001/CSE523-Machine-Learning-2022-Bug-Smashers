# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Introduction
Range of conditions that affect a person’s heart are termed coronary heart diseases (CHDs). In modern times, CHDs are one of the major causes of death worldwide with estimates of around 17.9 million deaths in 2019 according to WHO report [2]. This is further magnified by modern lifestyle choices such as stress, smoking, hypertension, abnormal blood pressure, etc.
We aim to answer the question whether it is possible to predict a coronary heart disease using Machine Learning algorithms.

## Results
For many algorithms, results are generated in a tabular form. Please have a look at the <a src="./Reports/10_Bug Smashers_End_Sem_Project_Report.pdf">report</a>.
